    `# Catastrophizing

When we catastrophize, we actually do two things: 
first, we predict the worst possible outcome;
second, we assume that if this outcome transpires,
we won’t be able to cope and it will be an absolute disaster.

## Example
"Why did I use that word in that email? I’m sure I’m going to get fired."`
