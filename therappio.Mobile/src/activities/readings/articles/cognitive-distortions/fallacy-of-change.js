    `# Fallacy of Change ♻️

This thought distortion assumes that others 
should change to suit your own interests.
If you often pressure others to change 
because you feel the change will bring you happiness or
have a conviction that your happiness is dependend on the person changing,
 then this may apply to you.

## Example

_"If I just encourage my wife to stop doing the things that irritate me,
I can be a better husband and a happier person."_`,
