    `# Disqualifying the Positive
    
You reject positive experiences by insisting they "don't count".
If you do a good job, you may tell yourself that it wasn’t good enough
or that anyone could have done as well. Discounting the positive
takes the joy out of life and makes you feel inadequate and unrewarded.
This allows your brain to stay in a pattern of negative thinking.
    
## Example
"− No one will ever love me." "− We love you." "− No, you don’t understand. No one will ever love me."`
