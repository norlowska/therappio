    `# 👍 Magnification and Minimization 👎

Expecting the worst, or bad things to happen -
includes both "magnification" or 
making things worse than they are,
and "minimizing" or ignoring the seriousness
of a situation because it seems too difficult.

## Example

_"This pandemic is going to last forever,
and I will never again be able to
spend time with my friends and get outside of my house"_`,
    // Two
  ],
  tags: ['cognitive-distortions', 'magnification', 'minimization'],
