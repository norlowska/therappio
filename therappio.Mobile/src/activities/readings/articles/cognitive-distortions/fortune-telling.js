Fortune telling is variant of jumping to 
conclusion distortion. When you commit
the fortune telling cognitive distortion,
you automatically predict that 
a negative outcome will come to fruition 
when thereâ€™s little to no evidence to suggest that will be the case.

_"I just know I will make a mistake and ruin everything."_`,
