    `# All Or Nothing Thinking
You see things black or white, good or bad, all or none.
You restrict possibilities and options to only two choices: 
_yes_ or _no_ (_all_ or _nothing_).
It has to be perfect or else youâ€™re a failure
  
## Example
  
_"I'm always a horrible mother."_
_"I'm never going to get it together."_`
