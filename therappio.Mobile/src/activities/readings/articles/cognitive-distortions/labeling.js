    `# Labeling and Mislabeling 🏷️

Both labeling and mislabeling are
forms of overgeneralizing. Labeling involves
taking one or two events as evidence for stereotyping
or applying a certain label to someone.
Mislabeling involves using overly exaggerated
emotional language to describe a situation in which it is not warranted.

## Example

_"“I made a mistake therefore I’m a failure."_`,
