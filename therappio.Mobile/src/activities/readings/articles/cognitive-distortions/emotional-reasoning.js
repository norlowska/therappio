    `# Emotional Reasoning ðŸŽ­

Emotions are extremely strong in people,
and can overrule our rational thoughts and reasoning.

takes over our thinking entirely, blotting out all rationality and logic.
The person who engages in emotional reasoning 
assumes that their unhealthy emotions reflect the way things really are.
